## Configuration and Change Management

To develop this project, we followed the Github Flow:

* Creating branches for new features (each branch has one or more (if very small) issues)
* Creating pull requests
* Merging pull requests to main branch if, and only if, they are approved
* Finally, deleting the branch once the merge is done
