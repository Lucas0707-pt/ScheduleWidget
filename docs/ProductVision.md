For students who want to check their schedule with fewer clicks, 
the schedule widget is a homescreen widget for mobile devices that aims to simplify the user experience by providing an interactive and easy way to access information.

our product improves the way users check their schedule information (like starting/ending time and classroom) without the need to access the UNI app by simply swipping through their schedule on the widget.
